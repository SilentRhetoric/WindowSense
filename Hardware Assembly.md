## Making a screen

Using a shape blade, score and then carefully break the plastic panel into a rectangle that is exactly XX by XX so that it will fit into the front cover of the case.

## Final Assembly

### Back plate 
1. Attach the Sense Hat to the Pi Zero header
2. Drop the combined Pi+HAT onto the standoff pegs of the case's back plate
3. Insert the nylon standoffs between the two PCBs of the Pi and the HAT where they are attached, and then the long screws through all three into the back plate.
4. Insert the short screws through the other two holes of the HAT
5. Plug in the USB cable and wrap it up around the standoff toward the top of the case and then back down so it can exit the case straight out the bottom

### Front cover
1. With the piece of plastic panel you cut, cut a slightly larger rectangle of the vinyl film
2. Prepare the plastic panel with a solution of soapy water so that you can reposition and smooth the vinyl when you apply it (it will dry invisibly)
3. Remove the vinyl's backing and apply it carefully to the plastic and then gently smooth out any bubbles using your finger or something with an edge that won't scratch the vinyl, such as a credit card
4. Once you are happy with the application of the vinyl, trim off any excess around the edges
5. Place the complete screen, vinyl side in toward the LEDs, into the raised outline which will help keep it in place.  You may want to secure the panel to the front cover with a tiny dot of glue.

### Putting it all together
1. Snap the back plate and front cover together--they are a friction fit
2. Place the joystick handle on the tiny joystick nub through the hole on the front of the case
3. Find a visible place to put the WindowSense on a wall or flat surface
4. Plug it in and get it running!
