# Learning Resources

I want to share a variety of resources that I have used as a complete novice maker to learn various skills I used to create this project.  I enjoy collecting bookmarks and hope that these links can help others find quality resources on their journey as a maker.

## Markdown

Several of the files in this repository were  written in the beginner-friendly Markdown language using the helpful syntax guide at [MarkdownGuide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  This simple language allows Github and other programs to generate attractive HTML from a syntax that is also readable as a plain text file.
